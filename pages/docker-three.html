I think thatâ€™s enough MySql for now, letâ€™s talk MySql in the context of Docker next.</p> <h2 id="why-we-need-a-mysql-docker-image-and-how-to-get-it-up-and-running-as-a-container"><a href="#why-we-need-a-mysql-docker-image-and-how-to-get-it-up-and-running-as-a-container" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why we need a MySql Docker image and how to get it up and running as a container</h2> <p>Ok so letâ€™s now say we want a container for our application. Letâ€™s furthermore say that our solution needs a database. It wouldnâ€™t make much sense to install MySql on the host the computer is running on. I mean one of the mantras of containers is that we shouldnâ€™t have to care about the the host system the containers are running on. Ok so we need MySql in a container, but which container, the apps own container or a separate container? Thatâ€™s a good question depending on your situation, you could either install MySql with your app or run it in a separate container. Some argument for that is:</p> <ul><li><strong>rolling updates</strong>, your database can be kept online while your application nodes do individual restarts, you wonâ€™t experience downtime.</li> <li><strong>scalability</strong>, you can add nodes to scale in a loosely coupled fashion</li></ul> <p>There are a lot of arguments for and against and only you know exactly what works best for youâ€Šâ€”â€Šso you do you ðŸ˜ƒ</p> <h3 id="mysql-as-stand-alone-image"><a href="#mysql-as-stand-alone-image" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> MySql as stand alone image</h3> <p>Letâ€™s talk about the scenario in which we pull down a MySql image. Ok, we will take this step by step so first thing we do is try to run it and as we learned from previous articles the image will be pulled down for us if we donâ€™t have it, so here is the command:</p> <blockquote><p>docker run --name=mysql-db mysql</p></blockquote> <p>Ok, so whatâ€™s the output of that?</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hrpOZwekpdv1yByOYQp4TQ.png" alt=""></p> <p>Pulling down the image, good, aaaand error.</p> <p>We are doing all kinds of wrong ðŸ˜¦.</p> <p>Database is uninitialized, password option is not specified and so on. Letâ€™s see if we can fix that:</p> <blockquote><p>docker run --name mysql-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=complexpassword -d -p 8000:3306 mysql</p></blockquote> <p>and the winner is:</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KM2niK5vNNUfVDDSX9SCYA.png" alt=""></p> <p>Argh, our container we started before is up and running despite the error message it threw. Ok, letâ€™s bring down the container:</p> <blockquote><p>docker rm mysql-db</p></blockquote> <p>and letâ€™s try to run it again with the database set like above:</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YQIXSpKvsdR0NqYG3oNbqQ.png" alt=""></p> <p>Ok, we donâ€™t get a whole bunch of logging to the terminal, because we are running in Daemon mode so letâ€™s run docker ps to check:</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hp8_3EcNM4oyUto2Gcgr6A.png" alt=""></p> <p>At this point we want to connect to it from the outside. Our port forwarding means we need to connect to it on 0.0.0.0:8001 :</p> <blockquote><p>mysql -uroot -pcomplexpassword -h 0.0.0.0 -P 8001</p></blockquote> <p>Ok, just a comment above we can either specify the password or just write -p and we will be prompted for the password on the next row. Letâ€™s have a look at the result:</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0dC2tjkdlD2byMFsYPj2Ug.png" alt=""></p> <p>Ok, we managed to connect to our database, it is reachable, great ðŸ˜ƒ.</p> <p>But wait, can we reach a database, inside of container, from another container?

That means we can either pull down an earlier version of MySql or revert to native authentication, your call ðŸ˜ƒ</p> <h3 id="linking"><a href="#linking" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Linking</h3> <p>The idea of linking is that a container shouldnâ€™t have to know any details on what IP or PORT the database, in this case, is running on. It should just assume that for example the app container and the database container can reach each other. A typical syntax looks like this:</p> <blockquote><p>docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name product-service <strong>--link mypostgres:postgres</strong> chrisnoring/node</p></blockquote> <p>Letâ€™s break the above down a bit:</p> <ul><li><strong>app container</strong>, we are creating an app container called product-service</li> <li>--link we are calling this command to link our product-service container with the existing mypostgres container</li> <li><strong>link alias</strong>, the statement --link mypostgres:postgres means that we specify what container to link with mypostgres and gives it an alias <code>postgres</code>. We will use this alias internally in <code>product-service</code> container when we try to connect to our database</li></ul> <p>Ok, so we think we kind of get the basics of linking, letâ€™s see how that applies to our existing my-container and how we can link it to our database container <code>mysql-db</code>. Well because we started my-container without linking it we need to tear it down and restart it with our --link command specified as an additional argument like so:</p> <blockquote><p>docker kill my-container &amp;&amp; docker rm my-container</p></blockquote> <p>That brings down the container. Before we bring it up though, we actually need to change some code, namely the part that has to do with connecting to our database. We are about to link it with our database container using the <code>--link mysql-db:mysql</code> argument which means we no longer need the IP or the PORT reference so our connection code can now look like this:</p> <div class="language-js line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-js"><code><span class="token comment">// part of app.js, the rest omitted for brevity</span>

Because we both changed the code and we added another library myql we will need to rebuild the image, like so:</p> <blockquote><p>docker build - t chrisnoring/node .</p></blockquote> <p>now letâ€™s get it started again, this time with a link:</p> <blockquote><p>docker run -d -p 8000:3000 --name my-container --link mysql-db:mysql chrisnoring/node</p></blockquote> <p>and letâ€™s have a look at the output:</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SxqwuggAPju3MpiJwy04sQ.png" alt=""></p> <p>We use the docker logs my-container to see the logs from our app container and the very last line says Connected! which comes from the callback function that tells us we successfully connected to MySql.</p> <p>You know what time it is ?

We managed to place the application in one container and the database in another container. Butâ€¦ This linking we just looked at is considered legacy which means we need to learn another way of doing linking. Waitâ€¦ Itâ€™s not as bad as you think, it actually looks better syntactically.</p> <p>This new way of doing this is called creating networks or custom bridge networks. Actually, thatâ€™s just one type of network we can create. The point is that they are dedicated groups that you can say that your container should belong to. A container can exist in multiple networks if it has cross cutting concerrns for more than one group. That all sounds great so show me some syntax right?</p> <p>The first thing we need to do is to create the network we want the app container and database container to belong to. We create said network with the following command:</p> <blockquote><p>docker network create --driver bridge isolated_network</p></blockquote> <p>Now that we have our network we just need to create each container with the newly created network as an additional argument. Letâ€™s start with the app container:</p> <blockquote><p>docker run -d -p 8000:3000 <strong>--net isolated_network</strong> --name my-container chrisnoring-node</p></blockquote> <p>Above we are now using the --net syntax to create a network that we call isolated_network and the rest is just the usual syntax we use to create and run our container. That was easy ðŸ˜ƒ</p> <p>What about the database container?</p> <blockquote><p>docker run -p 8000:3306 <strong>--net isolated_network</strong> --name mysql-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=complexpassword -d mysql</p></blockquote> <p>As you can see above we just create and run our database container but with the added --net isolated_network .</p> <p>Looking back at this way of doing it, we no longer need to explicitly say that one container needs to be actively linked to another, we only place a container in a specific network and the containers in that network knows how to talk to each other.</p> <p>There is a lot more to learn about networks, there are different types and a whole host of commands. I do think we got the gist of it, e.g how it differs from legacy linking.

Here is the thing. How we get that structure and seed data in there is a little bit up to you but I will try to convey some general guidelines and ideas:</p> <ul><li><strong>structure</strong>, you want to run this file at some point. To get in into the database you can either connect using the <code>mysql</code> client and refer to the file being outside in the host computer. Or you can place this file as part of your app repo and just let the Dockerfile copy the file into the container and then run it. Another way is looking at libraries such as Knex or Sequelize that supports migrations and specify the database structure in migrations that are being run. This is a bit different topic all together but I just wanted to show that there are different ways for you to handle this</li> <li><strong>seed</strong>, you can treat the seed the same way as you do the structure. This is something that needs to happen after we get our structure in and it is a one-off. Itâ€™s not something you want to happen at every start of the app or the database and depending on whether the seed is just some basic structural data or some data you need for testing purposes you most likely want to do this manually, e.g you connect to <code>mysql</code> using the client and actively runs the source command</li></ul> <h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Summary</h2> <p>Ok, this article managed to cover some general information on MySql and discussed how we could get some structural things in there like tables and we also talked about an initial/test seed and how to get it into the database using standalone files.</p> <p>Then we discussed why we should run databases in Docker container rather than installed on the host and went on to show how we could get two containers to talk to each other using a legacy linking technique. We did also spend some time cursing at MySql 8 and the fact the <code>mysql</code> Node.js module is not in sync which forced us to fix it.</p> <p>Once we covered the legacy linking bit we couldnâ€™t really stop there but we needed to talk about the new way we link containers, namely using networks.</p> <p>Lastly we shared some general guidelines on database management and hopefully, you are now at a point where you understand how we can add databases to our app and keep developing the app.</p> <p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_noring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>, happy to take your suggestions on topics or improvements /Chris</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
