Why Docker Compose why, not Docker something something, I said to a colleague? \n\n> Let's start from the beginning my colleague said. Let's start with Docker from the beginning.\n\n### The basics\nFirst thing you need to know is that there is a thing called images, containers and a `Dockerfile`. You build your images from a Dockerfile with a `docker build` command. The `Dockerfile` acts like a recipe for your image, what OS you need, what libraries to install, what variables to use and so on. At that point, he showed me a `Dockerfile`.

We can see this in action below:\n\n![](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/xgz8iqc5z4u321lfxvxb.png)\n\nWe see two things that point this out, one is `Step 1/7`.

The last layer is tagged with the name you give it in the `docker build`.   \n\n### Run/Stop a container\nOk, now that we have an image we have something that contains all we need, the OS, env files, our app and so on.

The easiest way is to find it's container id with `docker ps`. You don't need to enter full container id, just the 3-4 first characters. This should bring down your container. At this point, it still exists so you easily start it with `docker start [container id]`. \n\n### Docker Compose\n\n> Ok, so you taught me the basics of Docker with images, containers, and Dockerfiles. What about this Docker Compose?\n\nWell, Docker Compose is a tool you can use when you have many containers. To use it you need to define a `docker-compose.yml`. It's where you specify all your services, how to build them, how they relate, what variables they need and so on. You still use Dockerfiles though for each service but Docker Compose is a way to perform things on a group of images and containers. \n\nThis conversation carried out over the course of many weeks and I learned a whole lot in the process... :)\n\n##Â Summary\nAs you can see I was once at a place where I first wasn't using Docker at all. Then I came to use it as just commands I was copy-pasting and finally, I saw the light and realized I needed it. Which lead to this to 5 part guide eventually.  \n\n[5 part Docker series](https://dev.to/softchris/5-part-docker-series-beginner-to-master-3m1b)\n\nI hope the journey I told has been useful in teaching you what not learning a technology properly can have for consequences and that finally embracing it will mean you add a valuable tool to your toolset. I know many of you will or is probably following my footsteps, to some extent. So please read my 5 part series and I promise you, you will see the light\n\n\n")])]),e._v(" "),n("div",{staticClass:"line-numbers-wrapper"},[n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("1")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("2")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("3")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("4")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("5")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("6")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("7")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("8")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("9")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("10")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("11")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("12")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("13")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("14")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("15")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("16")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("17")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("18")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("19")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("20")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("21")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("22")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("23")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("24")]),n("br"),n("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("25")]),n("br")])])])},[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=s.exports}}]);
